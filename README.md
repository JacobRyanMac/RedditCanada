# Classifying the Canada Subreddit

This project was made with the intention of extracting comments from the subreddit "r/Canada" and store them within SQLite. The comments could then be processed and fed into a classifier algorithm so that it could understand and identify certain identities of comments.

The purpose of this was to learn more about extracting data from the web, organizing the raw data, and then mining that data for any interesting trends. There was also the goal of learning about language processing using the `nltk` package in Python, and how it can be used to train machine learning algorithms.

**This project is still under construction**
