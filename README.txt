# Canada subreddit to SQL
#
#===============================================================================

This project was made with the intention of extracting comments from the
subreddit "r/Canada" and store them within SQLite,

The purpose of this was to learn more about extracting data from the web,
organizing that data, and then mining that data for any interesting trends.

There was also a hope that I could use this data to predict the distribution
of words used in comment sections, given all the information of the submitted
link.
