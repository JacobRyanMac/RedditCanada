What do I want to create?

### Functions ###
- Make queries that will
  > Insert
  > Update
  > Delete??



### Methods ###
- Change a string to add quotes


### Objects ###
- Subreddits
  > Subreddit class needs to have properties that will determine how posts are extracted from it. that is: commentMin, ScoreMin, DatabaseDirectory to save to and such
  > Is this a subreddit or a database class? Think about it in SQL (it's the same thing)
  > They're the same entity as far as I'm concerned: name?
  > It's like a reddit instance, just make one but constantly reference it.
  > Subreddit is right...
  > Make one a subclass!
  > Do you make a database and then attach a subreddit.
  I'd say no
  You would want to make a subreddit, that collects posts, that extract comments, and then add it to the database

- Posts
  > Change to submissions
  >


Class methods affect entire class

from redditETL import ETL

redditETL.load('canada')
goes to

ETL.extract()
get from reddit

ETL.transfer()
transformer into statements

ETL.load()
put into SQL


Making the submissions is what is really happening.

Work on giving it a ;submission; from praw and outputting strings that are what we want
> takes submission, outputs an update
> takes submission, outputs an insert

> does the same for comment forests

Don't recreate what already exists within praw, just add the connectors to SQLite



HIERARCHY:

Deposit / category / subreddit
> could just call it a Canada
> If not it is wimply made for other classes

Database

Post / Thread

Comment



Subreddit is the root of all other classes.
    The current project will not go to subreddits outside of it's own

    The reasoning is that reddit as a whole has too much noise.
    Any attempt at predicition on such a broad level is more or less meaningless
    By using bayesian statistics, and conditional probability I can make more
    meaningful predicitions.

    Any other predicitions that one would want to make would need to be made on a subreddit by subreddit basis.
